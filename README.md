## Workday Planner 

Link to GitHub Pages: https://faduma92.github.io/jQuery-Event-Scheduler/

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) as well as the current date and day of the week using Momentjs.


Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.


Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.


The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.


Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
